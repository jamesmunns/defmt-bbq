//! # `defmt-bbq`
//!
//! > A generic [`bbqueue`] based transport for [`defmt`] log messages
//!
//! [`defmt`]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt
//! [`bbqueue`]: https://github.com/jamesmunns/bbqueue
//!
//! `defmt` ("de format", short for "deferred formatting") is a highly efficient logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, like microcontrollers.
//!
//! This crate stores the logged messages into a thread-safe FIFO queue, which can then be transferred
//! across any medium, such as USB, RS-485, or other transports.
//!
//! Although this crate acts as a `global_logger` implementer for `defmt`, it still requires
//! you to *do* something with the messages. This is intended to be a reusable building block
//! for a variety of different transport methods.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crates requires it's users to perform the following actions:
//!
//! 1. (optional): If you'd like to select a different queue size than the default
//!   1024, you'll need to set the `DEFMT_BBQ_BUFFER_SIZE` environment variable at
//!   build time to configure the size. e.g.: `DEFMT_BBQ_BUFFER_SIZE=4096 cargo build`.
//! 2. Prior to the first `defmt` log, the user MUST call `defmt_bbq::init()`, which will
//!   initialize the logging buffer, and return the `Consumer` half of the queue, which
//!   gives access to incoming logging messages
//! 3. The user must regularly drain the logged messages. If the queue is filled, any
//!   additional bytes will be discarded, potentially corrupting (some) logging messages
//!
//! For more information on the Consumer interface, see the [Consumer docs] in the `bbqueue`
//! crate documentation.
//!
//! [Consumer docs]: https://docs.rs/bbqueue/latest/bbqueue/struct.Consumer.html
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! #[entry]
//! fn main() {
//!     // MUST be called before the first `defmt::*` call!
//!     let mut consumer = defmt_bbq::init().unwrap();
//!
//!     loop {
//!         defmt::println!("Hello, world!");
//!
//!         if let Some(grant) = consumer.read() {
//!             // do something with `bytes`, like send
//!             // it over a serial port..
//!
//!             // Then when done, make sure you release the grant
//!             // to free the space for future logging.
//!             let glen = grant.len();
//!             grant.release(glen);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Default Feature(s)
//!
//! This crate has a single default feature, which enables the `encoding-rzcobs`
//! feature of the `defmt` crate.
//!
//! It is **strongly recommended** to leave this feature enabled (and to
//! use rzcobs encoding) when using this crate. If the buffer is ever overfilled,
//! then the remaining bytes will be discarded, which will temporarily corrupt
//! the message stream.
//!
//! Because rzcobs is delimited by zero bytes, it is possible to recover
//! from this corruption, with the loss of a limited number of messages.
//! When using the "raw" encoding, you MUST ensure that the buffer is
//! **never** overfilled, as it will NOT be possible to recover from this
//! error condition.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! This repository is a fork of `defmt-rtt`, obtained from the [`defmt`] repository.
//!
//! This repository was forked as of upstream commit `50e3db37d5429ed3344726f01e1bc4bf04902251`.
